# Trace

The following is the structure of the trace T in EBNF. There is an extra, 
better readable
explanation for all trace elements in the corresponding files in `traceElements`.
For the trace of each routine a separate trace file is created
```

For each trace a separate file is stored.
The elements in each file are separated by 
semicolons (;). The different fields in each element are seperated by 
commas (,). The first field always shows the type of the element:

- G: creation of a new routine
- A: atomic operation
- M: mutex operation
- W: wait group operation
- C: channel operation
- S: select operation

The other fields are explained in the corresponding files in the `traceElements` directory.
These files also describe how the trace elements are recorded.
For reordered traces, the trace can also include a stop signal "X".
If this signal is reached, the trace recording is stopped, and the 
program in allowed to continue freely.

## Implementation
The runtime of Go creates a struct `g` for each routine (implemented in `go-patch/src/runtime/runtime2.go`). This routine is used to locally store the trace for each routine. 
In it, an additional field is added, storing the id of the routine, a reference to `g` and the list of trace elements (`Trace`) recorded for this routine. When creating a new routine, this list is created. A reference to this list is additionally stored in a map called `DedegoRoutines`, to prevent if from being deleted by the garbage collector.

To record the exact temporal schedule of the program, a global counter is added, 
that is always implemented when the tace is changed. This counter is used as 
a timer in the trace.

In the runtime package, it is possible to get the `g` for the currently run routine. If an element that is supposed to be recorded happens, the routine grabs the `g` of the routine where it happens, and adds the new element to the Trace stored in this `g`. The implementation of the functions, that add the new elements in the trace can be found in `go-patch/src/runtime/advocate_trace.go` with additional functions in `go-patch/src/runtime/advocate_routine.go` and `go-patch/src/runtime/advocate_util.go`. The functions defined in `advocate_trace.go`, are called in the functions where the operations on Mutexes, Channels and so on are defined, to record the executions of those operations. The implementation of those functions are additionally described in the files of the respective elements in the traceElements folder.

After the program is finished, the Traces of all routines with references in `DedegoRoutines` are written into a single trace file by the header, that was 
added to the program.
