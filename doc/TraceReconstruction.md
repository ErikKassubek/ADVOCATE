# Trace reconstruction

## Problem statement

Given a trace T and two events e and f.
Find a valid trace reordering T' of T where e and f appear right next to each other in the trace.

If such a T' exists, we say that for T', e and f are *next to each other reordered* wrt T,
written T' = nextTo(T,e,f).


## HB-based trace reconstruction

Given a trace T where we have computed the <HB order for events in T.

Let e and f be two events in T where neither e <HB f nor f <HB e.
We show how to build a trace T' where T' = nextTo(T,e,f).

Suppose e appears before f in T

and

~~~~
T = T1 ++ [e] ++ T2 ++ [f] ++ T3
~~~~~~

where T1, T2 and T3 are subtraces and we write ++ for concatenation.

Take

~~~~
T' = T1 ++ T2' ++ [e,f]
~~~~~~~

where T2' = [ g | g in T2 and g <HB f ].


So, we push e "down" and T2 "up".
However, we only keep events in T2 that are in a HB relation with f.


Claim: T1 ++ T2' ++ [e,f] = nextTo(T1 ++ [e] ++ T2 ++ [f] ++ T3,e,f)
       where T2' = [ g | g in T2 and g <HB f ].


Note. Instead of [e,f] we can also consider [f,e] because e and f are not ordered under HB.

Proof.

Suppose g in T2 and e <HB g.
Then, g not in T2'.

Assume the contrary. If g in T2' we find that g <HB f.
In combination with the assumption e <HB g we derive e <HB f.
This contradicts the assumption that e and f are not ordered under HB.

Hence, we can argue that it is okay to put T2' "above" e.

Suppose g in T2 and g <MHB f.
That is, g must happen-before f where we assume that <MHB is derived from the [Go memory model](https://go.dev/ref/mem).
Our <HB relation conservatively approximates <MHB.
Hence, we conclude that g <HB f and therefore g in T2'.

Hence, we argume that T1 ++ T2' ++ [e,f] is a valid trace reordering.

QED.

### Case of thread-local traces

We rephrase "HB-based trace reconstruction" under the assumption that we have thread local traces.

* Events are ordered based on some total order <tr.

* The order <tr reflects the order in which events were processed when recording traces.

* Events are stored in thread-local traces.

* There are n threads where each thread i maintains its own trace L_i.


Let e in L_i and f in L_j be two events where neither e <HB f nor f <HB e.
We assume e <tr f.

Below is a description how to adjust thread-local traces such that e and f appear right
next to each other if we replay traces.


Consider event e's trace L_i.

~~~~
L_i = [ g | g in L_i and g <tr e ] ++ [e]
~~~~~~~~

We simply shorten the trace L_i by ignoring all events in thread i that were processed after e.


Consider event f's trace L_j.

~~~~~~~
L_j = [ g | g in L_i and g <tr e ]                             -- (1)
      ++
      [ g' | g' in L_i and e <tr g' and g' <tr f] ++ [f]       -- (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider part (1). These are all events g that were processed before e. So, we keep them.

Consider part (2). These are all events g' in thread j that were processed after e and before f.
We have that g' <HB f by construction as f is part of thread j.

*Updating the global trace order*. When replaying the trace, events g's shall be processed
before event e. Hence, we need to build a new global trace order relation <trNew
such that g' <trNew e for each g'.
(This is mostly an implementation detail. Efficiency matters as traces may be large).

For all other threads k where k != i and k != j.

~~~~~~~~
L_k = [ g | g in L_k and g <tr e ]                                  -- (1)
      ++
      [ g' | in L_k and e <tr g' and g' <tr f and g' <HB f]         -- (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~

We again need to update the global trace order for events g's in part (2).


If we want to "flip" e and f we simply switch their (global) trace positions.


### General case of n events e1,...,en

We can generalize trace reconstruction in case there are n events e1,..,en
where for each ei and ej where i !=j we find that ei and ej are unordered under HB.

*Do we need the general case? It seems for the analysis scenarios we consider, consider two events is sufficient.
 For example, in case of deadlocks we could restrict ourselves to two threads involved.*



### What about non-atomic variables?

Currently, we do not observe any non-atomic variables.

~~~~~
Question: Does this affect the claim the reordering constructed above is valid?
~~~~~~~

Based on the Go memory model, non-atomic variables do not imply any (must) happens-before relations.
For example, consider the following program

~~~~{.go}
go func() {
  x = 1
}()


go func() {
  if(x >= 1) {
  ...
  }
}()

~~~~~~~~~

and a possible program run represented by the following trace

~~~~~~
    T1     T2

1.  wr(x)
2.         rd(x)
3.         ...
~~~~~~~~

There is a write-read dependency. So, it seems that "..." must happen after the write on x in T1.
However, the read and write are in a race. Racy programs imply undefined behavior.

~~~~~
Answer to the above question:

Assuming the program is race-free, we can argue that the reordering is valid.
Rigorously formalizing the statement might be quite a challenge though.
~~~~~~~~


## Reconstructions for the different analysis cases

Note: Different to the recording, the reordered trace can contain float64 
times.

### Potential send/receive on closed channel
We assume, that the send/recv on the closed channel did not actually occur 
in the program run. Let c be the close and a the send or receive operation.
The global trace then has the form:
~~~~
T = T1 ++ [a] ++ T2 ++ [c] ++ T3
~~~~~~
We now reorder the trace to
~~~~
T = T1 ++ T2' ++ [X_s, c, a, X_e]
~~~~~~
where T2' = [ g | g in T2 and g <HB c ].\
For send on close, this should lead to a crash of the program. For recv on close, it will probably lead to a different execution of program after the 
object. We therefor disable the replay after c and a have been executed and 
let the rest of the program run freely. To tell the replay to disable the 
replay, by adding a stop character X_e.


### Close on closed channel and actual send/recv on closed
We only record actually executed operations. For close on closed, we can therefore only detect actually occurring close on close. Reordering is therefore not necessary.
The same is true for actual send/recv on closed


## Done before add
We assume, that the program run that was analyzed did not result in a negative 
wait counter. Therefore we know, that for a wait group, the number of add is greater or 
equal than the number of done. From the analysis, we get an incomplete but
optimal bipartite matching between adds and dones. For all dones $D$, that are 
not part of this matching, meaning they do not have an earlier add associated 
with it, we can find a unique add $A$, that is concurrent to $D$. For 
each of those $D$ we now shift all elements that are concurrent or after $D$
to be after that $D$. This includes the $A$.


## Select without partner

TODO: Implement

## Mixed Deadlock

TODO: Maybe implement

## Cyclick Deadlock
We already get this (ordered) cycle from the analysis (the cycle is ordered in 
such a way, that the edges inside a routine always go down). We now have to 
reorder in such a way, that for edges from a to b, where a and b are in different 
routines, b is run before a. We do this by shifting the timer of all b back,
until it is greater as a.

For the example we therefor get the the following:
~~~
  T1         T2          T3
lock(m)
unlock(m)
lock(m)
           lock(n)
lock(n)  
unlock(m)
unlock(n)
                       lock(o)
           lock(o)     lock(m)
           unlock(o)   unlock(m)
           unlock(n)   unlock(o)
~~~

If this can lead to operations having the same time stamp. In this case, 
we decide arbitrarily, which operation is executed first. (In practice 
we set the same timestamp in the rewritten trace and the replay mechanism
will then select one of them arbitrarily).
If this is done for all edges, we remove all unlock operations, which 
do not have a lock operation in the circle behind them in the same routine.
After that, we add the start and end marker before the first, and after the 
last lock operation in the cycle.
Therefore the final rewritten trace will be
~~~
  T1         T2          T3
start()
lock(m)
unlock(m)
lock(m)
           lock(n)
lock(n)  
                       lock(o)
           lock(o)     lock(m)
end()
~~~

## Leaks

### Channel
There are two possible cases, either the stuck channel is unbuffered, or it is 
buffered.

#### Unbuffered Channels
Buffered channels must communicate concurrently. If an unbuffered channel operation $c$ is 
stuck, we check if there is a possible concurrent communication partner. If there 
is non, we cannot rewrite the channel to get unstuck. This does not mean, 
that it is impossible to run the program without getting stuck, e.g. with an 
communication operation, that was not executed and therefore recorded in the run.
If there is, the operation must have communicated with another operation, 
otherwise it would have communicated with $c$. Lets assume $s$ is the send 
and $r$ the receive of this communication. The trace where $c$ got stuck must 
therefore be one of the following
~~~
T_1 ++ [s] ++ T_2 ++ [r] ++ T_3 ++ [c_s] ++ T_4
T_1 ++ [s] ++ T_2 ++ [r] ++ T_3 ++ [c_r] ++ T_4
T_1 ++ [s] ++ T_2 ++ [c_s] ++ T_3 ++ [r] ++ T_4
T_1 ++ [r] ++ T_2 ++ [c_r] ++ T_3 ++ [s] ++ T_4
T_1 ++ [c_s] ++ T_2 ++ [s] ++ T_3 ++ [r] ++ T_4
T_1 ++ [c_r] ++ T_2 ++ [r] ++ T_3 ++ [s] ++ T_4
~~~
if we sort by TPre. $c_rs$ could both be a receive or a send, $c_r$ would only be a 
receive and $c_s$ a send. We already know, that 
$s$ must be concurrent with $r$, otherwise the communication wouldn't have
happened. We also know from the analysis, that $c_s$ and $r$ or $c_r$ and $s$
must be concurrent. Additionally we assume, that $c_s$ and $r$ or $c_r$ and 
$s$ are also concurrent. If this is not the case, we assume, we cannot 
rewrite the trace with the selected possible partner.
We can therefore rewrite the trace as:
~~~
T_1 ++ T_2' ++ [X_s, c_s] ++ T_2'' ++ T_3' ++ [r, X_e]
T_1 ++ T_2' ++ [X_s, s] ++ T_2'' ++ T_3' ++ [c_r, X_e]
~~~
where T_2' are all elements from T_2, that must be before $c_s$ or $s$,
T_2'' all element from T_2 that must be before $x_r$ or $r$ but are not in T_2'
and T_3' all elements from T_3, that must happen before $r$ or $c_r$. $X_s$ 
and $X_e$ are marker for the replay. $X_s$ will only print a message, but not 
effect the replay itself. $X_e$ will print a message and then disable the
replay. After this the program will continue to run, without following a 
given trace.


#### Buffered Channels
Leaks on buffered channels do not depend on whether there is a concurrent 
communication partner. There are two cases, in which a buffered channel 
can refuse to send/receive and get stuck. Either the program tries to 
send on a channel with a full channel buffer, or it tries to receive on 
an empty buffer.

If a send $s$ is stuck, we check if there is are sends $s'$, that is concurrent 
to $s$, but happened before it in the program run. If such $s'$ exists, we
reorder the trace in such a way, that $s$ is no before all those $s'$.\
Equivalently, is a recv $r$ is stuck, we try to find recvs, that are
concurrent to $r$, but happened before $r$ in the program run, and 
order then, such that they happen after $r$. In practice, we remove them 
and all other elements that are after them and in the same routine
from the trace such that $r$ is moved before them automatically, and let the 
program run freely after executing $r$, by adding the $X_e$ control element.


### Select
TODO: NOT IMPLEMENTED YET

### Mutex
A mutex can only be blocked by a lock operation $l$. This operations blocks, 
if the mutex is currently hold by another block operation. Because $l$
was blocked at the end of the program run, there is another lock operation $l'$,
which was fully executed, but there was no unlock operation. Because a potential later 
unlock of this mutex was not recorded, it is not possible to try to move it 
before $l$. Therefore we can only try to solve this stuck operation, if $l$ and 
$l'$ are concurrent. In this case, we can try to execute $l$ before $l'$ to see, 
if this prevents the stuck operation. 
We therefore rewrite the trace from
~~~
T_1 ++ [l'] ++ T_2 ++ [l] ++ T_3
~~~~
to 
~~~
T_1 ++ T_2' ++ [l, X_e]
~~~~
where X_e ends the guided replay and lets the rest of the program play out 
by itself. T_2' is the set of all elements, that are before $l$.
 
### Wait Group
Only the wait in a wait group can lead to an actual leak. This happens, when the 
wait group counter is not 0 at any time after the wait command. We can 
only influence the counter for the wait, by moving adds and dones, that are 
concurrent to the wait. To minimize the counter as much as possible, we need 
to move as many done before and as many add after the wait. We do this,
moving all elements, that are concurrent with the stuck wait to be after 
the wait. To make sure, that we do not create a negative wait counter, we 
keep the order of those moving elements the same as before the rewrite.

### Conditional Variables
For a conditional variable only the wait operation can block. The block can be
ended by a Signal or Broadcast call.

If there is a Signal $s$, that is concurrent to the blocking wait $w$, there are 
two possible cases. Either $s$ was executed before $w$ or $s$ was executed 
after $w$ but released another wait $w'$.\
If $w'$ is HB before $w$, we cannot use this signal to release $w$, because 
signal wakes the wait in the order in which the waits where started. If 
$w'$ is concurrent with $w$, we move $w$ to be before $w'$. If $w$ was executed 
after $s$, we move $s$ to be before $w$. Unfortunately, waits are always 
surrounded by lock operations, which in out HB relation scheme create a happens 
before relation. With this, this type of reorder is not possible. For this 
reason, it is currently necessary to run the analyzer with `-c`, which disables
the happens before relation of mutex operations.

If there is a Broadcast call $b$, that is concurrent to the blocking wait $w$, 
but happened before it in the program run, we can move $b$ to 
be after $w$, by moving all elements that are concurrent to $b$ to be before $b$.
