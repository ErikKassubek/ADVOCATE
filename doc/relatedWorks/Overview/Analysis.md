# Analysis

The Go runtime is able to detect the actual occurrence of certain concurrency bugs like send on closed channel or global deadlocks [^15].

Static approaches like GCatch [^1] and GoGuard [^2] focus on detecting misuse of Go's channel-based concurrency using constraint solving and resource flow graphs, respectively. GCatch [^3] identifies blocking bugs via a static constraint system, while GoGuard [^4] generalizes detection of blocking bugs across concurrency primitives using a may-happen-in-parallel simulation that mimics real execution behavior. GoDetector [^5] complements these with a hybrid pushdown automaton-based system for detecting WaitGroup- and channel-related concurrency bugs.

Dynamic techniques have proven especially useful for discovering bugs manifesting under specific schedules. Tools like FastTrack [^6] leverage vector clocks for precise dynamic race detection, while MagicFuzzer [^7] and UNDEAD [^8] focus on scalable deadlock detection. MagicFuzzer prunes lock dependencies and introduces thread-specific strategies to improve detection efficiency, whereas UNDEAD offers always-on deadlock prevention in production systems with minimal runtime overhead.

GOAT [^9] combines dynamic tracing with guided schedule exploration and visualization for effective debugging. Automated Dynamic Concurrency Analysis for Go [^10] and Two-Phase Dynamic Analysis [^11] both extend tracing with vector-clock-style postmortem analysis, supporting root cause diagnosis and schedule analysis across large trace spaces. Two-Phase Dynamic Analysis for Go employs vector clocks across traced message-passing events to reconstruct happens-before relationships, allowing it to explore behavior that might result from alternative schedules.

Beyond detection, a critical task in concurrency debugging is understanding failing executions. Tinertia [^12] addresses this with a heuristic for trace simplification, iteratively coarsening preemption points while preserving the bug. This approach makes failure traces significantly more interpretable and actionable.

Go-Oracle [^13] takes a machine learning approach, training a transformer model on execution traces to distinguish between passing and failing behaviors.

Predictive concurrency analysis tools such as SeqCheck [^14] offer formal guarantees by checking whether a potential bug pattern (represented as an event sequence) could occur based on program, observation and lock order.
