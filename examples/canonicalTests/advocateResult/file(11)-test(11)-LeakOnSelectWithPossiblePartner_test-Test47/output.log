Welcome to the trace analyzer and rewriter.
This program analyzes a trace file and detects common concurrency bugs in Go programs.
It can also create a reordered trace file based on the analysis results.
Be aware, that the analysis is based on the trace file and may not be complete.
Be aware, that the analysis may contain false positives and false negatives.

If the rewrite of a trace file does not create the expected result, it can help to run the
analyzer with the -c flag to ignore the happens before relations of critical sections (mutex lock/unlock operations).
For the first analysis this is not recommended, because it increases the likelihood of false positives.

ReplayWarning: Long wait time
No traced operation has been executed for a long time.
This can be caused by a stuck replay.
Possible causes are:
    - The program was altered between recording and replay
    - The program execution path is not deterministic, e.g. its execution path is determined by a random number
    - The program execution path depends on the order of not tracked operations
    - The program execution depends on outside input, that was not exactly reproduced
If you believe, the program is still running, you can continue to wait.
If you believe, the program is stuck, you can cancel the program.
If you suspect, that one of these causes is the reason for the long wait time, you can try to change the program to avoid the problem.
If the problem persist, this message will be repeated.
