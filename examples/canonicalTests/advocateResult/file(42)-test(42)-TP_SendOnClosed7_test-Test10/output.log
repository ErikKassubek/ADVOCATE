Welcome to the trace analyzer and rewriter.
This program analyzes a trace file and detects common concurrency bugs in Go programs.
It can also create a reordered trace file based on the analysis results.
Be aware, that the analysis is based on the trace file and may not be complete.
Be aware, that the analysis may contain false positives and false negatives.

If the rewrite of a trace file does not create the expected result, it can help to run the
analyzer with the -c flag to ignore the happens before relations of critical sections (mutex lock/unlock operations).
For the first analysis this is not recommended, because it increases the likelihood of false positives.
