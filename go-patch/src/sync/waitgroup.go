// A WaitGroup waits for a collection of goroutines to finish.
// The main goroutine calls Add to set the number of
// goroutines to wait for. Then each of the goroutines
// runs and calls Done when finished. At the same time,
// Wait can be used to block until all goroutines have finished.
//
// A WaitGroup must not be copied after first use.
//
// In the terminology of the Go memory model, a call to Done
// “synchronizes before” the return of any Wait call that it unblocks.
