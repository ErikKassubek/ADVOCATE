Reading trace from rewritten_trace_4
Replay enabled

ReplayWarning: Long wait time of approx. 10s.
No traced operation has been executed for approx. 20s.
This can be caused by a stuck replay.
Possible causes are:
    - The program was altered between recording and replay
    - The program execution path is not deterministic, e.g. its execution path is determined by a random number
    - The program execution path depends on the order of not tracked operations
    - The program execution depends on outside input, that was not exactly reproduced
If you believe, the program is still running, you can continue to wait.
If you believe, the program is stuck, you can cancel the program.
If you suspect, that one of these causes is the reason for the long wait time, you can try to change the program to avoid the problem.
If the problem persist, this message will be repeated every approx. 10s.
